  DialogueText: "Seeing as this is a demo, before we begin this little adventure,
    let\u2019s go over the rules. This is a choose-your-own-adventure experience
    - meaning, yes, you have free will and can make choices as you see fit.\r\nAlthough
    you may want to explore off the beaten path, for the sake of a smooth and safe
    experience, I strongly encourage you to follow my directions. Think of it as\u2026
    cooperation, rather than restriction. After all, I only want what\u2019s best
    for you.\r\nIn order to make a choice, hover over the option with your mouse
    and click with the primary button.\r\n\r\n"
